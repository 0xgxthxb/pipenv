Remove usage of pipfile module in favour of Plette.
pipfile is not actively maintained anymore. Plette is actively maintained,
and has stricter checking of the Pipefile and Pipefile.lock. As a result,
Pipefile with unnamed package indecies will fail to lock. If a Pipefile
was hand crafeted, and the source is anonymous an error will be thrown.
The solution is simple, add a name to your index, e.g, replace::

   [[source]]
   url = "https://pypi.acme.com/simple"
   verify_ssl = true

With::

   [[source]]
   url = "https://pypi.acme.com/simple"
   verify_ssl = true
   name = acmes_private_index
